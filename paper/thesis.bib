  title={Ornamental algebras, algebraic ornaments},
  author={McBride, Conor},
  year={2011},
  annote = "The author presents a principled method for constructing new types from old types using a datatype called an ornament. A new type may be related to an old type by subsuming its structure (e.g. the structure of a list subsumes the structure of a natural number), or by refining its index (e.g. a vector's natural number index refines a list's unit index). This construction comes with a generic forgetful function (called an ornamental algebra) that converts a value of an ornamented type to a value of the underlying type that was ornamented. The definition of ornaments in this paper is defined in terms of the universe of indexed families of types presented in \cite{Chapman:2010:GAL:1932681.1863547}."

A super universe adds a code for codes in the previous universe, and a code for the meaning function of codes in the previous universe. The super universe is stratified at the lowest level, where the set of codes for the previous universe is the empty set, and the meaning function is {\it ex falso quodlibet}."

Standard intentional type theories have a definitional equality which does not support functional extentionality, but type checking is decidable. Observational Type Theory (OTT) is intentional, but adds a new propositional equality that supports functional extentionality. Values can be explicitly coerced between observationally equivalent types by supplying a proof of an isomorphism between the types."

In particular dependent functions (\textPi), dependent pairs (\textSigma), and wellorderings / inductive types (W) are covered. Additionally, the important concept of a type theoretical universe is explained, which consists of a set of codes representing types, and a meaning function translating codes into concrete types. This notion of a universe is the primary method by which generic programming is performed in dependently typed languages."

One common alternative eliminator is course of values induction.

The second kind of generic programming involves functions that operate generically over the arity of a single type (e.g. a {\tt zipWith} that can map over any number of list arguments). Both of these forms of genericity have been explored independently, but the authors show how to write functions that are simultaneously generic over a universe and the arity of a particular type in that universe."
