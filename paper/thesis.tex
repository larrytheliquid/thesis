%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Morris thesis distinguishes syntactic (concrete) prog from
%% semantic (generic) prog. this is bc container/w types (semantics)
%% are a large translation from from their declarations
%% IR is less of a translation, almost to the point that generic
%% prog is also syntactic (counterexample is Rec arg with Unit domain)
%% another way this thesis is different is closed universes
%% gelim `Desc shows how we can get more syntactic
%% truly syntactic GP using Irish IR, but not semantically understood
%% Generic semantic Swedish function has Unit codomains
%% also big translation of product or dis-union infinitary types
%% Generic Swedish also supports large IR, which W does not
%% But Irish still does not handle List (Rose A) translation
%% can always copy Desc of list into Rose, but then cant pass a List in
%% However Exp (Maybe A) does work with large RI
